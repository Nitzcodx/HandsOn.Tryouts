Note: 'counter' is a static member variable.

 

Logic to be implemented:

StudentDelegate delegate

	Create a delegate named ‘StudentDelegate’ that will accept methods which have return type void and accept an object of Student class as a parameter. The delegate should be created at namespace level.

Address class

	Property

		The automatic properties AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City should be created as per the class diagram

		The value for Pincode should be between 0 and 999999 (both inclusive). Else it should be set to 570010

	Parameterized Constructor

		The properties AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City and Pincode should be initialized with appropriate values

Student class

	Property

		The automatic properties CollegeFees , Gender , Marks , SportsQuota and StudentName should be created as per the class diagram

	Parameterized Constructor

		The properties Gender , Marks , SportsQuota and StudentName should be initialized with appropriate values

College class

	Property

		The automatic properties CollegeId and CollegeName should be  created as shown in the class diagram

	Parameterized Constructor

		The CollegeId should start from 1001 and auto-incremented every time an object of the class is created. Member variable counter is used to assign a CollegeId.

		The property CollegeName is set to the corresponding parameter passed in the constructor.

GovtCollege class

	Parameterized Constructor

		The property CollegeAddress should be initialized with appropriate values and appropriate value should be sent to the base class constructor

	CalculateFeesBasedOnMarks method

		If the Marks of the student is greater than 80, CollegeFees should be set to 20000, else to 35000

	CalculateFeesBasedOnSportsQuota method

		If the student has SportsQuota, then CollegeFees should be decremented by 5000

	SetFees method

		Create a single StudentDelegate object

		Add references of both “ CalculateFeesBasedOnMarks” and “CalculateFeesBasedOnSportsQuota” methods of GovtCollege class in the same order to the delegate object

		Invoke the delegate with a student object

PrivateCollege class

	Parameterized Constructor

		The properties PrivateCollegeAddress and Donation should be initialized with appropriate values and appropriate value should be sent to the base class constructor

	CalculateFees method

		If Marks is greater than 75 and Donation is greater than 100000, set CollegeFees as CollegeFees=75000-(Donation*0.5)

		Else set CollegeFees to 75000
