Vehicle Class

    FuelLevel Property
        This property validates the fuelLevel value based on whether the Vehicle is TwoWheeler or a FourWheeler.

         If the vehicle is TwoWheeler the maximum value can be 10.

         If the vehicle is FourWheeler the maximum value can be 50.

        If the value being set is greater than the maximum value permissible, the fuelLevel is set to the maximum value.

        Otherwise the fuelLevel is set the value passed.

    Parameterized  Constructor
        The properties should be initialized appropriately.

    FixBrakes()
        If the brakes are not working, this method sets areBrakesWorking to true and returns true.

        Otherwise false is returned.

FourWheeler Class

    EngineCoolantLevel Property
        This property validates the engineCoolantLevel.

            If the value passed is ‘H’ or ‘M’ or ‘L’ engineCoolantLevel is set to the passed value

            Otherwise the engineCoolantLevel is set to ‘H’.

    Parameterized  Constructor
        The inherited properties should be set by invoking the base class constructor.

        The properties of FourWheeler Class should be initialized.

    

    FixEngineCoolantLevel()
        If the EngineCoolantLevel is not ‘H’, set to ‘H’ and return true.

        Otherwise return false.

    UpdateVehicleStatus()
        This method is used to update the vehicle status.

            If the EngineCoolantLevel is ‘L’ or the brakes are not working set the VehicleStatus to “Critical”.

            Otherwise the VehicleStatus is set to “OK”.

    RefuelVehicle()
        This method accepts the volume of fuel to be refilled.

             If the sum of FuelLevel and volume of fuel to be refilled exceeds the capacity (50) then a FuelOverflowException should be raised and caught inside the method.In this case set volume of fuel to be refilled as 0.

             FuelLevel should be updated with the volume of fuel to be refilled.

TwoWheeler Class

    ChainTension Property
        This property validates the chainTension.

            If the value passed is between 1 and 9(inclusive of both), the chainTension is set to the passed value.

            Otherwise the chainTension is set to 7.

    Parameterized  Constructor
        The inherited properties should be set by invoking the base class constructor.

        The properties of TwoWheeler Class should be initialized.

    FixChainTension()
        If the ChainTension is not 7, set to 7 and return true.

        Otherwise return false.

    UpdateVehicleStatus()
        This method is used to update the vehicle status.

            If the chainTension deviates from 7 by more than 2 or if the brakes are not working set the VehicleStatus to “Critical”.

            Otherwise the VehicleStatus is set to “OK”.

    RefuelVehicle()
        This method accepts the volume of fuel to be refilled.

            If the sum of FuelLevel and volume of fuel to be refilled exceeds the capacity (10) then a FuelOverflowException should be raised and caught inside the method.In this case set volume of fuel to be refilled as 0.

            FuelLevel should be updated with the volume of fuel to be refilled.

Maintenance Class

    RefuelVehicle()
        This method accepts the Vehicle object and the volumeToBeFilled parameter .

            Invoke RefuelVehicle method of the Vehicle by passing volumeToBeFilled as a parameter to update the FuelLevel.

            Check whether the FuelLevel before update and FuelLevel after update is same. 

                If it is same, volumeToBeFilled is set as 0.

            The MaintenanceCharges is increased by value volumeToBeFilled * 70. 

    ServiceVehicle()
        This method accepts a Vehicle type and performs the following procedure on it.

            The vehicle status is updated by calling its UpdateVehicleStatus method.

            If the updated VehicleStatus is 'Critical',

                The FixBrakes method of the vehicle is invoked. If the method returns true the MaintenanceCharges are increased by 20.50.

                Check whether the vehicle is TwoWheeler or FourWheeler.

                    If the vehicle is a TwoWheeler call its FixChainTension method. If it returns true increase MaintenanceCharges by 30.75.

                    If the vehicle is a FourWheeler call its FixEngineCoolantLevel method. If it returns true increase MaintenanceCharges by 50.20.

                Set the VehicleStatus to 'OK'
